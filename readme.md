This project is a calculator:

 - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation or square root

- Asks the user for the first number;

- Ask which operation they would like to perform;

- Asks the user for the second number and generates the result;

- Once the result has been generated, it asks the user if they would like to do a new operation with the result of the previous operation or if they would like to do another operation by typing in a new number.
